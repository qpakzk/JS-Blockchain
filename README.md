  This repository is Blockchain Development  with Javascript. I reference [Savjee youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxrdFPXJMeHru_b4Q_vTPQ) : Building a blockchain with Javascript.

  There are three parts.

  * [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HneatE69814&list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiTqZmbtFisdXFxul5k0F-Q4&index=2) is implementing Proof-Of-Work(POW) in Javascript.
  * [part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRV6cGXVQ4I&index=3&list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiTqZmbtFisdXFxul5k0F-Q4) is miner rewards & transaction - Blockchain in Javascript.
